<font color="red" size="4">Prepare for a web 1.0 WAKING NIGHTMARE! Herein lies some sick-ass horror cinema, if 
you should dare to accept the <b>Challenge</b>.<br>
Getting psyched for Halloween? Can't wait for season two of <i>Stanger Things</i>? Tired of watching the same old movies they always air on AMC? <br>Why not use this opportunity to test your limits? 
The rules are simple: Pick a few movies off the list and shuffle them into your Halloween movie roster. <br>Watch as many as you can tolerate during the month of October, then score yourself on the following chart:
<br><br><br><br><br>
<U>The Zombie:</u><br>
Watched three movies
<br><br><br><br>
<U>The Ghoul:</u><br>
Watched six movies,
then one Mystery movie 
<br><br><br><br>
<U>The Vampire:</u><br>
Watched nine movies, then two Mystery movies
<br><br><br><br>
<U>The Fiend:</u><br>
Watched EVERY SINGLE movie on the list
<br><br><br><br><br>

The title of each entry in the list will link to the film's IMDB page, and at the bottom of each entry
is a link to the stream. <br>These streams exist in a legal "grey area", and therefore you may wish to cover your tracks 
(or not, as no one really cares).<br> I recommend the <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> internet browser, which has a free built-in VPN. Also you
should probably get some anti-malware/adblockers, <br>as these streams are usually full of bullshit like that.
<br>And at any rate, 
brace yourself for...

<i>The Evil Dead</i> is a critically important movie for many reasons, foremost of which is
launching director Sam Raimi's career. It also launched a horror trilogy completely beyond comparison,
one that helped dictate what horror would (and could) be. Unlike the rest of the trilogy however, 
<i>The Evil Dead</i> features no comedy--only terror. It pushed the limits of what was allowed
by censors in the early 80's and is full of creative and traumatic gore. The setting is isolated and
the characters few, but <i>The Evil Dead</i> uses this minimalism against the audience to great effect. Given a
rookie director and next to no budget, <i>The Evil Dead</i> still shines as a master-craft horror.

This movie is hilarious, but it's also surprisingly solid. Too weird to be mainstream, <i>Phantasm</i>
is popular with a fanbase that doesn't require a movie to be traditionally "good." Much of it is 
stolen, piecemeal, from other works including Stephen King's <i>IT</i> and Frank Herbert's novel
<i>Dune</i>. The acting is not great, the effects are cheap-ish, and the plot is technically shitty. Yet somehow this movie is extremely
likeable. It's got some unusual gore, and in fact everything that isn't copied from somewhere else is pretty 
damn original. The antagonist is sufficiently menacing and is a great example of a unique movie demon.
All in all <i>Phantasm</i> is worth a watch, if only for the pleasure of busting its balls and seeing some crazy shit. 
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
This one's pretty easy to watch, as it's not complex in any way. Being a little drunk helps. A fun
side project is to compare this film against two others on the list: <i>The Amityville Horror</i>, which came out in the same year, 
and <i>The Exorcist</i>, another (much better) seventies demon movie.

What can you say about a movie like <i>Lost Highway</i>? Only that it is a one-of-a-kind. Like 
all films by director David Lynch, the most important content is written between the lines. The story
and visuals are a distraction meant to confound the brain while the subtext beams
emotions directly into your subconscious (you'll see what I mean). There is a plot of sorts, but it's a non-linear mess of violence and intrigue that defies the viewer's attempts to follow it. As far as Lynch goes, this work is mid-tier
complex, and as such has many of the same things a normal movie would. <i>Lost Highway</i> touts 
a badass soundtrack, some super-sweet titties, and plenty of fucked-up-creepy imagery among its merits--but 
that's only the tip of the terror iceberg.
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
You can't really plan for a movie like this. That being said, it's a long movie (at just over two hours)
so don't start this one unless you really mean it. Another consideration is volume; this movie
is of that type that rapidly goes from quiet to very loud without warning, so be mindful.

It's really impossible to describe <i>Troll 2</i>, because the more accurately you describe it
the less believable it sounds. With that being said this movie really is possibly the worst movie ever made, 
and that's where all its merit is derived. There's nothing else quite like it. If you've just watched 
<i>Videodrome</i> or <i>Se7en</i> and you're in a really weird, dark place: watch this movie next. 
It'll cleanse your palate with its own special brand of insanity and hopelessness.

<br>
<font color="red" size="4">
Though many movies claim to be "based on a true story," <i>The Amityville Horror</i> actually is
(at least more than most). Whatever the cause, in 1975 a real family personally experienced many of the events depicted
in the film. Loosely based on their accounts, this movie is an important piece of 
late-seventies cinema. It established and refined many classic horror tropes that are still being used today.
Sadly, <i>The Amityville Horror</i> has been largely forgotten due to its relaxed 70's pace and the
multitude of legendary films that came out around the same time. But it's an endearing and inspiring
film that you could never make today (as evidenced by the piss-poor remake in 2005).
<br>
<b>Method:</b>  
<br>
This movie's pacing is a little dated, and things don't really get rolling until around 45 minutes 
in. Make sure you're not in danger of falling asleep or you might.

<br>
<font color="red" size="4">
Not strictly speaking a horror movie, <i>They Live</i> makes the list for a number of colorful reasons.
First off, it's creepy without being scary or disturbing, leaving you with more of a subtle feeling of 
unease than anything. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and incorporates its own absurdity in
a very casual way. It's also thoroughly masculine, featuring a professional wrestler (no, seriously) as the Gordon
Freeman-esque protagonist. Finally, <i>They Live</i> is a powerful--if somewhat obvious--allegory for
clandestine class warfare and justified paranoia that I believe every human being could benefit from seeing. 
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
This movie was made before the nineties, and accordingly it drags a bit in the beginning. But once it gets going,
it becomes hilariously good. I recommend using the first thirty minutes to get good and blasted, don't
overthink the plot, and think about how (if at all) this movie might reflect what's going on in the world.

Another non-horror, <i>Se7en</i> nevertheless features some of the most horrific scenes to come out of the 90's.
This movie also has an exceptional cast, with both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman hunting a super-secret villain (do 
yourself a favor, don't check the imdb on this one). <i>Se7en</i> was too gory and fucked up to really 
be a success, but it helped Brad Pitt reach an insane height of fame--and with good reason. It also
left a significant impact on film culture, and has been parodied on <i>Robot Chicken</i> and other places that 
I can't remember right now (The Office?). Another forgotten gem of the nineties.
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
The most important thing--more important even than with a normal thriller--is to avoid spoilers, and 
it's totally worth it. Also, be prepared for some wild shit.

This early nineties film featuring Kevin Bacon lies right at the crossroads between grisly monster horror and 
wacky adventure hijinks. So while there is a sense of danger and urgency, there's also an endearing rural
vibe that relaxes the whole thing and allows the film a less severe pace. <i>Tremors</i> is great for 
taking a break from the gruesome terror of other entries on this list, such as <i>The Evil Dead</i>, or the 
<i>The Exorcist</i>. It's also the only true "Monster Movie" on this list, and has the unique benefit
of that genre: a monster is something you can fight. 
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
This movie is casual as all hell. I recommend cracking open a cheap American beer (or several) and

<i>Videodrome</i> is a strange, uncomfortable movie from legendary horror director David Cronenberg.
Bordering on the pornographic, it's is full of dark things that a healthy mind would never dream of; you're going to see some <i>really</i>
weird stuff. And yet, despite being filmed in the 80's, this film
predicts many problems posed by the modern internet culture and expounds on them. It's a visceral mindfuck
that you may have to watch a few times to fully puzzle out. Needless to say it's not for everybody,
but if you can get past the insanity it's ultimately a very rewarding and unique film.<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
This movie pairs pretty well with alcohol--I recommend taking a shot (or maybe a sip) every 
time you ask yourself, "what am I seeing right now?" or "who made this movie and why?" Also, not even
joking, this movie frequently sounds like a weird porno. Plan accordingly.

<i>The Exorcist</i> is arguably the most iconic horror movie ever filmed. To this day (FORTY YEARS LATER)
if you put the word "exorcist" in your movie's title, you'll make a stupid amount of money regardless of said
movie's content or quality. This is largely because <i>The Exorcist</i> scared whole generations of people shitless. 
It was easily ten years ahead of its time, set the standard for excellence in a number of horror subgenres, 
and helped establish the 1970's as one of cinema's strongest decades. Rarely has horror been risen
to such a level of art. If you haven't seen it, watch it, because you're really missing out.  
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
Ok, so yes it's slow. All movies from this time period are, but this one is especially so. It's meant
to be a creeping, building horror. I think one could argue it never really gets "exciting" but that's 
not really what it was going for. Just hang on through the first half and you'll be golden. Watch sober, preferably alone, in perfect darkness.

When most people think of Dracula, they picture the black-and-white Bella Lugosi Dracula of 
Paramount Pictures. <i>The Horror of Dracula</i> (1958) is a slightly more modern re-telling of the classic 
Bram Stoker novel. Made in Great Britain by Hammer Films, <i>The Horror of Dracula</i> 
features a very young Christopher Lee as the eponymous character and Peter Cushing as Dr. Van 
Helsing. This movie is an historically important one as it represents a transitionary period between the fifties and sixties, making early use of techniques 
such as neon-red blood and dynamic fight scenes. In fact, I would argue that many modern vampire movies
draw their imagery largely from standards set in this Dracula's gruesome example.
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
Oh man but this movie is boring, and I'll be the first one to say it. The purpose it serves is
more of a piece of history than an actual scary movie. Just look at how young Saruman is, it's 
adorable! It's worth a watch for the hardcore horror enthusiast, but set your expectations accordingly.

Less a scary movie and more a Halloween movie, <i>Donnie Darko</i> still manages to be dark and 
brooding in a very unsettling way. The innocent setting of 1980's suburbia belies a weird evil
lurking just under the surface, with electric pop ballads providing a strange background for the
creepy supernatural happenings. There's some great spooky imagery, but it's well balanced with comic relief and
good storytelling. This movie also features an illustrious cast: Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, 
Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and a comically young Seth Rogen all contribute to a pensive theme of
impending disaster. 
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
<i>Donnie Darko</i> is super watchable due to the good pacing and awesome production. I recommend the
director's cut, as it's much easier to follow the story in that one.

If I can trick even one person into watching this movie, the purpose of this list will be fulfilled.
<i>Suspiria</i> is the secret italian horror masterpiece only the most hardcore motherfuckers have ever heard of. Set in a ballet academy
somewhere in Europe, the baroque color saturation alone will completely overload your senses. Add
in brilliant cinematography, a fucking loud and unnerving soundtrack and some over-the-top gruesome
death scenes and you'll be thoroughly rattled. Not to mention it's the single best example of a specific 
and well known (but way under-utilised) horror premise. This is terror like you've never seen it. 
<br>
<b>Method:</b>
<br>
This movie hits the ground running, deliberately scaring your shit within the first ten minutes.
The old quiet/LOUD game applies here <u>big time</u>, and you might even want to watch it with headphones.

It seems like most people are hesitant to watch this movie, and I understand. Anyone who has seen it can tell you, it pushes the limits of
 brutality like no movie before it (and very few since). But <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> is way more than just torture porn. Every 
 element projects despair, from the dark and filthy scenery to the almost non-existant soundtrack. Much like <i>The Evil Dead</i>, 
 this movie manages to create a rich three-dimensional wolrd using very simple practical effects and less than ten actors. This is a film 
 that absolutely terroirizes, and will likely stick with you for years.
<br>
 <b>Method:</b>
<br>
You can get fucked up before watching this movie, but I don't recommend it. It's so excessively brutal that you'll want all your wits about you
 to defend against it. It does take a little while to really start swinging, but rapidly goes from zero to 100%. Cut the lights and get comfortable.

<font color="red" size="4">
So I decided that the movie orignally billed as Mystery Movie 2 was too fucked up. Here is my substitution: <i>Repulsion</i>, an equally
 good psychological horror by master director Roman Polanski. This movie is pretty disturbing, but not on the visceral level of say <i>
 Se7en</i> or <i>Videodrome</i>. This is a movie that gets in your head. The goal of <i>Repulsion</i> is to build an uncomfortable level of tension
 and leave the viewer with a weird, lingering dissonance. Frankly, there aren't a whole lot of movies to compare it to. Widely considered to be
 one of the best works of a great director, <i>Repulsion</i> holds a special place in cinema history. 
 <br>
 <b>Method:</b>
Made in 1965 on virtually no budget, this movie is pretty dry compared to the sensory overload of <i>Suspiria</i> or the baroque gore of <i>Phantasm</i>.
 Nonetheless, it's a great work of art that deserves contemplation. I wouldn't watch it in mixed company; there's some traumatic scenes 
in this one that not everybody is going to be a huge fan of.

 <i>Braindead</i> (or <i>Dead Alive</i> in New Zealand) is, bar none, the most gore-filled movie I've ever seen. Director Peter Jackson (of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fame)
 goes so far over the top in this film that by the end you can barely comprehend it. And yet, despite that, <i>Braindead</i> is also a
 subtle and beautiful piece of art in every other respect. The story is good, the characters are well-thought-out and memorable, and the practical effects 
 are executed perfectly. Every type of horror you can think of is mastered: gore, jumpscares, gross-out, body horror, emotional trauma--
 other kinds I can't even put a name to. And on top of all this, it's HILARIOUS. Like, maximum volume laughing hilarious. It's criminal
 that most people have never heard of it. If there's a single movie on this list that you need to see, it's <i>Braindead</i>.

 <b>Method:</b>
 You seriously can't prepare for this movie. It's unlike anything that's ever existed. Alcohol pairs well, but if you get too drunk
 you might throw up--it's hard not to even when you're sober. You might even consider taking a break halfway through, because the second half
 is a heavy psychological load. Try be ready for anything.
